    ]

    for question_text in default_questions:
        Question.objects.create(question_text=question_text, is_default=True)

4- This will load all the default question in the system (34).

5- Make migrations and migrate if necessary (shouldn't be the case because the migrations file is present).

6- Run the server:

     python manage.py runserver 

     
The Questions tab in admin will show all the default 34 questions, that can be modified by the admin and the changes will propagate throughout the site. 

The Parishs tab contains all Parishs created.

The Inspections tab contains all Inspections created.

The Inspection questions tab contains all responses of users for their inspections.
